The role is the\n      purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a\n      pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon\n      (wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface\n      (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a\n      shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).\n\n      A surface can have only one role at a time.

A sub-surface has one parent surface.

The order of which one happens\n      first is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes\n      hidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply\n      recursively through the tree of surfaces.\n\n      The behaviour of a wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface\n      depends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are\n      synchronized and desynchronized, see methods\n      wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized\n      mode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's\n      state gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending\n      wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the\n      synchronized mode.\n\n      Sub-surfaces also have another kind of state, which is managed by\n      wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests.

This state is applied when the parent surface's\n      wl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.\n      As the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.\n\n      The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,\n      since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.\n\n      Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as\n      in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in\n      synchronized mode.
