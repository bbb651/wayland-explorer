    "text": "This protocol allows a compositor to suggest for surfaces to render at\nfractional scales.\n\nA client can submit scaled content by utilizing wp_viewport. This is done by\ncreating a wp_viewport object for the surface and setting the destination\nrectangle to the surface size before the scale factor is applied.\n\nThe buffer size is calculated by multiplying the surface size by the\nintended scale.\n\nThe wl_surface buffer scale should remain set to 1.\n\nIf a surface has a surface-local size of 100 px by 50 px and wishes to\nsubmit buffers with a scale of 1.5, then a buffer of 150px by 75 px should\nbe used and the wp_viewport destination rectangle should be 100 px by 50 px.\n\nFor toplevel surfaces, the size is rounded halfway away from zero. The\nrounding algorithm for subsurface position and size is not defined.",
