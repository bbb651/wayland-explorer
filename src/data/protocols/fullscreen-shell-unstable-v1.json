While there technically may be multiple\nclients bound to this interface, only one of those clients should be\nshown at a time.\n\nTo present a surface, the client uses either the present_surface or\npresent_surface_for_mode requests.  Presenting a surface takes effect\non the next wl_surface.commit.  See the individual requests for\ndetails about scaling and mode switches.\n\nThe client can have at most one surface per output at any time.\nRequesting a surface to be presented on an output that already has a\nsurface replaces the previously presented surface.  Presenting a null\nsurface removes its content and effectively disables the output.\nExactly what happens when an output is \"disabled\" is\ncompositor-specific.  The same surface may be presented on multiple\noutputs simultaneously.\n\nOnce a surface is presented on an output, it stays on that output\nuntil either the client removes it or the compositor destroys the\noutput.  This way, the client can update the output's contents by\nsimply attaching a new buffer.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and\nbackward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes\nmay be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.\nBackward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in\nthe protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.\nOnce the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the\nversion number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the\ninterface version number is reset.",
