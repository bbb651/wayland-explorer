    "text": "This protocol provides the ability to have a primary selection device to\nmatch that of the X server. This primary selection is a shortcut to the\ncommon clipboard selection, where text just needs to be selected in order\nto allow copying it elsewhere. The de facto way to perform this action\nis the middle mouse button, although it is not limited to this one.\n\nClients wishing to honor primary selection should create a primary\nselection source and set it as the selection through\nwp_primary_selection_device.set_selection whenever the text selection\nchanges. In order to minimize calls in pointer-driven text selection,\nit should happen only once after the operation finished. Similarly,\na NULL source should be set when text is unselected.\n\nwp_primary_selection_offer objects are first announced through the\nwp_primary_selection_device.data_offer event. Immediately after this event,\nthe primary data offer will emit wp_primary_selection_offer.offer events\nto let know of the mime types being offered.\n\nWhen the primary selection changes, the client with the keyboard focus\nwill receive wp_primary_selection_device.selection events. Only the client\nwith the keyboard focus will receive such events with a non-NULL\nwp_primary_selection_offer. Across keyboard focus changes, previously\nfocused clients will receive wp_primary_selection_device.events with a\nNULL wp_primary_selection_offer.\n\nIn order to request the primary selection data, the client must pass\na recent serial pertaining to the press event that is triggering the\noperation, if the compositor deems the serial valid and recent, the\nwp_primary_selection_source.send event will happen in the other end\nto let the transfer begin. The client owning the primary selection\nshould write the requested data, and close the file descriptor\nimmediately.\n\nIf the primary selection owner client disappeared during the transfer,\nthe client reading the data will receive a\nwp_primary_selection_device.selection event with a NULL\nwp_primary_selection_offer, the client should take this as a hint\nto finish the reads related to the no longer existing offer.\n\nThe primary selection owner should be checking for errors during\nwrites, merely cancelling the ongoing transfer if any happened.",
