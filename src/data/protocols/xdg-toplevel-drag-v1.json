        "text": "This protocol enhances normal drag and drop with the ability to move a\nwindow at the same time. This allows having detachable parts of a window\nthat when dragged out of it become a new window and can be dragged over\nan existing window to be reattached.\n\nA typical workflow would be when the user starts dragging on top of a\ndetachable part of a window, the client would create a wl_data_source and\na xdg_toplevel_drag_v1 object and start the drag as normal via\nwl_data_device.start_drag. Once the client determines that the detachable\nwindow contents should be detached from the originating window, it creates\na new xdg_toplevel with these contents and issues a\nxdg_toplevel_drag_v1.attach request before mapping it. From now on the new\nwindow is moved by the compositor during the drag as if the client called\nxdg_toplevel.move.\n\nDragging an existing window is similar. The client creates a\nxdg_toplevel_drag_v1 object and attaches the existing toplevel before\nstarting the drag.\n\nClients use the existing drag and drop mechanism to detect when a window\ncan be docked or undocked. If the client wants to snap a window into a\nparent window it should delete or unmap the dragged top-level. If the\ncontents should be detached again it attaches a new toplevel as described\nabove. If a drag operation is cancelled without being dropped, clients\nshould revert to the previous state, deleting any newly created windows\nas appropriate. When a drag operation ends as indicated by\nwl_data_source.dnd_drop_performed the dragged toplevel window's final\nposition is determined as if a xdg_toplevel_move operation ended.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing\nphase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the\ncorresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can\nonly be done by creating a new major version of the extension.",
